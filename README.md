# Hisilicon ION Userspace implementation

This is just the stock AOSP ION library, but it includes the ION functions added by HiSilicon.

Those functions were reversed engineered and rewritten from scratch by me, since no other OEM released such functions.

The stock ION library is placed inside `system/core/libion`
